        <h3>Description</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="resume">Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe <br> produces thick,
        fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few <br> ingredients that are probably already in your
        kitchen (and it's so much better <br> than the boxed stuff).</p>
    <h3 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients-list">
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk,
            melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the <br> batter onto the griddle,
            using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook <br> until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to
            3 minutes. Flip and cook <br> until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>

    </ol>
